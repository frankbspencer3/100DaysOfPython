###Day 1 Notes###
###These notes are not for learning, but for documentation purposes###

- Learned primarily about variables, input, and print statement
- May have also learned the difference between concatenation and addition
- Also learned about len function

- Installed pycharm/netbrains. Pycharm seems like overly powerful training wheels
	- it gives so much information about whats going on with my code that makes me have to not think
	- may not be good to use long term
