###Day 17.1 Supplement Notes###

name = the dog name, breed = the dog breed, age = the dog age, new_name = the dogs name after name change. 

self is used to reference the constructed object, this way each object can have its attributes set separately. 

bark() just stores a strong in a variable that is returned. when the method is called, it prints the string

rename takes 1 argument and reapplies the argument to the self.name attribute of whatever object self is, self being the instance what was called, in this case Dog1.

the two objects behave independently because they are constructed separately. Dog1 is its own construction of the Dog class and Dog2 is also its own construction of the Dog class

every dog starts at age = 0, and this is an attribute every dog initializes with. the birthday method simple takes the age of the called dog and increments by 1, and then returns the age
