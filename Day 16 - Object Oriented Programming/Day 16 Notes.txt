###Day 16 Notes###
###These notes are not for learning, just for documentating my progress###

Long list of stuff today
-Learned about OOP
	- CLasses, Objects, Methods
	- Classes are objects defined by variables (attributes) and methods (functions)
	- Modules are files
	- from turtle (module) import Turtle(class), Screen(class)
	- other options is to import turtle, use turtle.Turtle(), assign it to something, and then call functions for it
		- franklin = turtle.Turtle(), franklin.color("green"), franklin.shape("turtle")
	- pay close attention to what parameters a method asking for. sometimes it may be the item or a sub-item
	- generally good practice to assign methods/returns to variables. this lets you use and compare them 
	

-Learned about pipy for packages
	- Had to " python -m venv venv" to create virtual environment for 100DoP project since I split off from AY project files due to course progression
	- now have venv folder in 100DoP root
	- ps - .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1, win bash - source venv/Scripts/activate, linux bash venv/bin/activate
	- also found out deleting .idea/folder was a bad move since thats one of the reasons i had to set up an interpreter separately. just had to reopen the project in pycharm 
	- aslo also figured out that pycharm interpreter settings are no longer directly in the project like shown in 100DoP course
		- settings are under file > settings > python > interpreter > drop down
		- didnt notice this before so not sure if .venv was needed but it likely was 
	- installed prettytable 3.13 to match my python 3.13
	- also note, did not use pip. used GUI option
	- documentation for how to use packages is MASSIVE in writing code with packages
	- i thought i was going to have 1 venv for my 100 days. now im not so sure with what that means for interpreter and package management

-Learned a little about WSL and Installed Ubuntu 22.04
 	- I had WSL feature installed but never installed distro
	- Installed Ubuntu 22.04 due to weight and necessity of tools
	- Did all this because PS is too cumbersome to make new files for documentation
	- Looked at both VIM and Nano, not interested in VIM short cuts so Im using Nano
	- Good news I can also go back and add notes from previous two weeks as well for learning
	- Should help cement knowledge by writing and going over what ive learned
	- also need to remember to use "WSL" command to activate WSL before using Nano

-Also learned about .gitignore and why i shouldnt delete that (i should probably stop deleting stuff in general xD)
	- Accidently uploaded .idea/ to Git since I didnt realize it shouldnt be tracked and should be added to .gitignore
	- created new .gitignore file with "nano .gitignore" in 100DoP directory and added .idea/ and venv/ 
	- Used "git rm -r --cached .idea" to remove .idea folder from git tracking (--cached removes tracking but doesnt delete locally")
	- commited and repushed so that .idea is no longer tracked
