###Day 3 Notes###
###These notes are not for learning, but for documenting###

- Learned about flow control with if/else operators
- Can nest if/else
- if does not need matching else
	- Boolean values do need escape
	- if you write an if that returns true, you need to write an evaluation that can return false

- learned modulo operator
	- % - returns the remaineder
	- 5%3 = 2
	- 6%3 = 0

- can also use elif for multiple if cases

- also did some git learning on this day
	- created a tracking file at first because git does not track empty folders
		- you need some sort of file for git to track in order to track folders
	- also had the issue of day ordering
		- I wrote "Day 1", "Day 2", and "day 3" as folder names
		- day 3 being lower cased messed up the folder ordering on github
	- git revert <commit hash>
		- creates a new commit that does undoes the old commit; does not delete history
	- git reset --hard <commit-hash>
		- removes commit from github history
		- probably not good for shared projects 
	- git reset --soft/mixed/hard  HEAD~1
		- different effects but all undo commits. generally will use soft

	- git reset <filename>
		- undoes file staging from git add 
	- git status 
		- check current staged and unstaged files
	- git log 
		- check history of pushes/commits
